Noto Simple is a WordPress theme with a simple design using Google’s Noto font.

## Description

Noto Simple is developed based on the following concepts.

### Simple design

The theme has only minimum stylings to make the site readable, without uniqueness nor characteristics.

### Multi-language font

Noto font provides different font files for each character set of various languages. The theme itself only loads Noto Sans with the basic latin character set, so it's
 recommended to use [Noto Font Loader](https://github.com/htmsk138/noto-font-loader) that automatically loads the correct font file for your site's language. The plugin also lets you use Noto Serif besides Noto Sans.

### Accessibility

It meets below accessibility standards:

* Visitor can navigate within the site with only keyboards
* Voice reader can read the contents in the correct order
* The background colour and the text colour have enough contrast
* The site is readable to anyone regardless of their type of colour vision.

### Customise features

The site owner can customize the site’s look in admin panel:

* Choose the blog-related pages’ sidebar position (none, left and right)
* Upload logo image (to be displayed instead of site title)
* Upload background image

## Changelog
